This project aims to use Octopus to scrape job listings from BOSS in the corresponding industry and to test the technological requirements of most companies through automated tools. 
Since Octopus requires a domestic phone number for registration, we can only substitute it with handwritten Scrapy. 
This is the first mission for the Scrapy tool.
